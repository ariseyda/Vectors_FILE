# Vectors_FILE
 Define a structure type named vector2_t which contains x and y components of a vector. Define a function to prompt user to enter x and y values for a vector. Define a function to print a vector on console. Define a function to compute sum of two vectors. Test your functions in a program that asks user how many vectors is going to be entered and then computes sum of all the vectors. Program should create an output .
 
 how many vectors will be summed? 3 
 
enter x component of vector: -1.1 enter y component of vector: -1.1 
 
enter x component of vector: 2.2 enter y component of vector: 2.2 
 
enter x component of vector: 3.3 enter y component of vector: 3.3 
 
    (-  1.100x -  1.100y)     
    (+  2.200x +  2.200y)
