# Vectors_FILE
 Define a structure type named vector2_t which contains x and y components of a vector. Define a function to prompt user to enter x and y values for a vector. Define a function to print a vector on console. Define a function to compute sum of two vectors. Test your functions in a program that asks user how many vectors is going to be entered and then computes sum of all the vectors. Program should create an output .
